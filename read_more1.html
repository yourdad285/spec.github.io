                    <p id="info2"><br>Getting into the immersive technology and making it feasible was the sole purpose of
                        the
                        talk by MS. <strong> Bhuvana Meenakshi Koteeswaran</strong>, on 1 February 2020 at <strong>NITH</strong> during Electrothon 2020.
                        Bhuvana is WebXR/AR/VR evanglist and a prominent Mozilla Rep. She has been conferred
                        with
                        the most prestigious award "Dr. Kalam young achievers award" in the year 2017 for her projects
                        on
                        open source and society beneficial application.</p>
                        <p></br>
                    The talk started with a fun interaction including puns and jokes related to the
                        technology
                        sector. Later, she introduced the participants with the basics of AR/VR . What does the 'Virtual
                        Reality' means? How to make someone understand, the uses and advantages of these emerging
                        technologies? Then the audience witnessed the world of AR, VR and XR. She simplified the
                        definition
                        of 'virtual reality' as 'near reality', as the word virtual means near and reality is what we
                        experience as a human being. The talk explained the various uses and advantages of webXR /AR/VR
                        such
                        as how it is far more portable than any other platform and all you need is a web browser to use
                        it.
                        Explaining furthermore, she told the students the concept of XR, wherein 'X' is yet to be filled
                        with a new thing. They were described as the key portals into the immersive technology. The
                        basic
                        introduction was followed by services provided by Mozilla to access and build upon AR and VR.
                        Mozilla hubs is a VR chatroom designed for every headset and browser. As the students haven't
                        came
                        across Mozilla rather than it's Firefox browser, she used that opportunity to rightly propagate
                        about the community and how they involve themselves in volunteer contribution. Mozilla provides
                        platforms WebXR, WebVR, WebAR as developer portals for the creators to work upon their ideas and
                        build interactive games and services. The services cover umpteen number of domains . Varying
                        from
                        education and healthcare to entairnment and infotainment. One such instance was described , in
                        which
                        an application was developed for simulation of prototyping of PCBs.
                        </p>
                        <p><br>
                    More than 200 students attended the talk and were enlightened by the knowledge and
                        wisdom
                        delivered by Bhuvana. It ended with a display of an immersive game. A live game room was created
                        in
                        the form of an island. People joined in the room and landed upon the island and could access
                        it's
                        virtual assets via their mobile phones. The game proved to a great stress buster to the
                        participants
                        of the hackathon. We hope all the students of NITH will again get this pleasure of meeting her
                        in
                        the future and learning something out of the box.</p>
